# TriviaGame

## What This Project Does
This project allows the user to play a trivia game based on the science fiction author William Gibson.  Each game is 10 questions long with a 15 second time limit per question.

## Why This Project Is Useful
In addition to being a coding exercise for its developer, the game is meant primarily for the user's entertainment and to test their knowledge over William Gibson.  The results provide the user with a score that indicates how well they performed at the game.

## How Users Can Get Started With The Project
After clicking the start button, the first question is displayed.  A 15 second timer begins with the time left displayed in the upper right corner.  The user must select one of the radio buttons cooresponding to an answer and hit the Submit Answer button before time is up, or the question is counted wrong.  There is only one correct answer per question. After selecting an answer, the outcome is displayed for a few seconds before moving on to the next question.  After 10 questions, a game over screen will be shown with the user's score and a button to restart the game.
